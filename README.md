## Welcome to my Project!


# 3D 2048
This will be a 4 4x4 cubes, using the same gameplay loop as the popular game 2048.

## Arrays
This project should use 3D arrays to store the location of different #'s of different sizes

## Try-Catch 
This project uses try-catch functions to deal with possible overflow given the large amount of failed random numbers that are generated.

## recursion?
It uses a weird and inefficently twisted version of recursion, but it works.



# Displaying Three Dimensional Projects
So, given the need to see all components in this 3x3 cube, using a 3D graphical system will possibly obscure important information. (How would you see the middle block?) That, and my lack of skill means that some way to format this in 2D is best.
My plan at the moment is to display each slice of the cube side by side. That will give the user all the information in a (hopefully!) useful way.
