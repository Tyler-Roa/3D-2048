## Welcome to my Project!

MIGHT BE WRITTEN IN UNITY!!!

# 3D 2048
This will be a 3x3 cube, using the same gameplay loop as the popular game 2048.
## Arrays
This project should use 3D arrays to store the location of different blocks of different sizes



# Displaying Three Dimensional Projects
So, given the need to see all components in this 3x3 cube, using a 3D graphical system will possibly obscure important information. That, and my lack of skill means that some way to format this in 2D is best.
My plan at the moment is to display each slice of the cube side by side. That will give the user all the information in a (hopefully!) useful way.
